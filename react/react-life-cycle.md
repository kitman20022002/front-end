#React Life cycle

- Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
- The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.


## Mounting
- Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

## componentDidMount
- The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
- This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.
