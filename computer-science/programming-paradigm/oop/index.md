# OOP 

## Keypoints
- Structure: Classes, Object, Methods, Attributes
- Principles: Encapsulations, Abstraction, Inheritnace, Polymorphism 
- Benefits: Modularity, Reusability, Producity, Easily upgrade and scalable, Security, Flexibility
- Criticism of OOP: OP overemphasizes the data component of software development and does not focus enough on computation or algorithms

## Principles 
- Encapsulation: Important information is contained inside an object
- Abstraction: The derived class can have its functionality extended
- Inheritnace: Classes can reuse code from other classes
- Polymorphism: Objects are designed to share behaviors and can take on more than on form
