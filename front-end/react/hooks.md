# Hooks 

### Key Points
- Only for function compoment



## React Defined Hooks 
### useEffect() : 
- Allows us to track state in a function component
- Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it
- State generally refers to data or properites that need to be tracking in an application

- Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it

tells react that your compoment needs to do something after render. Similar to CompomentDidMound and componentWillUnmount

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
  ```
