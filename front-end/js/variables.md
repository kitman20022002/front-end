# Variables

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
- Scope

## Tag
glossary,js,front-end

## Key points:

- Two things to understand
  - declare a variable 
  - use a variables
- We must declear a variable before using it 
- A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
- Three statement for variables: var, let, const
- 5 types:  Numbers, String, Booleans, Array, Object


## Definition
- A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

## Use cases
- When you need to store and use a value later in the program you write

## Not to use 
- When you don't need to use it later in the program

## Example
```
var hi = 0
```
## Declare a variables
Declear A variable = STATMENT + NAME + VALUE (eg: var a = 3)

### STATMENT
3 types
- var i = 0 
- let i = 0
- const i = 0
- 
#### var
- Can be assign in runtime(when the code is running)
- Function-scoped or global variables
  
#### let 
- Can be assign in runtime(when the code is running)
- Block-scoped local variables

#### const
- Must initialize when you declare them
- Can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.
- Block-scoped local variables

### NAME
- name cannot contain spaces.
- name must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
- name can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
- name are case-sensitive.

### VALUE 
5 types of value 
### Types
#### Numbers
eg: 0, let i = 0

#### Strings
eg: "hi", let i = "hi"


#### Booleans
eg: true , let i = true

#### Arrays
eg: [] , let i = []

#### Objects

eg: {} , let i = {}
