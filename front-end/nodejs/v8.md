# V8

- Written in C++
- The engine compiles and executes the JS code
- The engine creates and handles the call stack
- The engine creates and manages the memory heap
- The engine handles the garbage collection
- The engine provides all the data types, objects and functions

# (Node.js) uses LibUV or Browser itself

- Event loop :
- Thread Pool (database, File system network and other)
- IO Queue \ Timer queue

When a Request comes in -> goes to hardware OS -> then LibUV -> Event Queue -> Event Loop -> Thread Pool

validate token with database

1. When a request comes in where does it acutally go ?
2. How can I start debbuging that
3. Difference between V8 , LibUV and how does it return back to my code
