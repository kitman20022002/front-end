# Variables

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
- Scope

## Key points:

- A variable = statment + name + value 
- A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
- Three statement for variables: var, let, const
- 5 types:  Numbers, String, Booleans, Array, Object

## Example
```
var hi = 0
```

## Statement

### var
- Can be assign in runtime(when the code is running)
- Function-scoped or global variables

### let 
- Can be assign in runtime(when the code is running)
- Block-scoped local variables

### const
- Must initialize when you declare them
- Can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.
- Block-scoped local variables

### Difference between var, let 
- The difference is the scope, however we are not gonna explain in here, this concepts would be explained in more details once we go deep more into JS

## Types


### Numbers

### Strings

### Booleans

### Arrays

### Objects
